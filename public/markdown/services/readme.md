# First things first

If you want to use my services through my portfolio (the desktop interface you're probably using) you **need** to install my SSL certificates (both the root and intermediate ones) on your machine. Otherwise, it will throw an error.

If you don't want to install the certificates, but still want to use the services, just open them in another window (through the mouse middle click on the icon).

# Usage Etiquette

I am a single developer, doing this from my own passion. I am not particularly experienced in security, and therefore these applications might have some security flaws. If you find one of them, I beg you not to exploit it. I'd also love to hear about it, and learn how to patch these flaws. You can contact me through my e-mail: jeansidharta@gmail.com
